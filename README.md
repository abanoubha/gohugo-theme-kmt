Kmt is the [ancient name of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt#Names) (my home country). See [the demo here](https://abanoubhanna.com/).

## Features

- __speed page loading__: surf the web at the speed of thought

## Installation

Run this command while you are inside the folder of your Hugo site:

```sh
git submodule add  -b main --depth 1 https://github.com/abanoubha/hugo-theme-kmt.git themes/kmt
```

Add the themeâ€™s directory to your `config.yaml` or `config.toml`:
